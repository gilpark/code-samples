A side boom caterpillar then picked up the pipe and laid it into the trench, requiring skill and coordination between the operator and crew members.",

After the pipes were trimmed and fitted, line-up clamps were run through each and given a welded stringer bead, tacking them into position. Welders then attached all the sections with a finishing bead, stronger than steel pipe itself.",

This trench most likely was dug using a combination of the two methods. Explosives were then placed inside the trench and ignited to deepen and widen it.",
